# ==================================================
# Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter.
#
# Description:
#   By default Black looks for `pyproject.toml` starting from the common base directory of all files and directories
#   passed on the command line. If it's not there, it looks in parent directories. It stops looking when it finds
#   the file, or a `.git` directory, or a `.hg` directory, or the root of the file system, whichever comes first.
# Note:
#   If you're asking yourself "Do I need to configure anything?" the answer is "No".
#   `Black` is all about sensible defaults.
